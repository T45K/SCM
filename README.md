# SCM 
SCM is a clone (duplicated code) ditection tool.
Based on the concept of [Code Clone Matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.05615.pdf), SCM detects code fragments similar to query.
SCM can detect type 1 (exact copy) and type 2 (renamed) clones.

**Tips**<br>
SCM is developed for my learning of **String Search Algorithm**. 
I can't guarantee it will work properly.

## Requirements
